      <p>The language is referred to as “Mmen” to outsiders which is the same designation given to the people group. It is referred to as “Ewâmnèə Mə̂yn” (the speech of Mmen) by speakers of the language. The name Mmen refers to both their language and their land. The name Mmen [mə̂yn] comes from the verb sé myə̀yn ‘to open up thick, bush-covered land’ and is used by the speakers to refer to both their language and their land. Mmen is the name of the village where the largest number of speakers is found. Simons, Gary F. and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2017</p>
